# Python_19_06
# Overview 
Modern software projects often suffer from inefficient algorithms and high time complexity, leading to poor performance and scalability issues. Optimizing these bottlenecks is critical to ensure code can run effectively across varied platforms and workloads.

This project aims to build an intelligent Time Complexity Optimiser capable of analyzing code written in Python and C++, identifying potential complexity issues, and recommending optimizations to improve algorithmic performance.

The tool will serve developers by providing insightful, actionable reports that pinpoint inefficient constructs (like nested loops, redundant recursions, suboptimal sorting), and offer alternative, more efficient approaches (such as hash maps instead of linear scans, more efficient sorting algorithms, etc.).
